My name is Alex Narvaez-Duckworth. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, and I am also a participant in the Penn FinTech Bootcamp!
I would like to reach the top of my field in my career and particularly work in disruptive financial technology as well as in the application of blockchain to real world problems.
I chose the FinTech career path because of the changing financial landscape.
